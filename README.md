# Purpose of Project
    The goal of this project is to practice the use of Javascript forms, inputs, and methods  implementing their use with React App to provide a game in which a use navigates a maze. 

# Wireframe / Overview

    First section will be some quick instructions for the user, followed by a form to create the initial size of the playing field. 

    User will be able to create the field of a desired size and the playing field will be initialized. 

    States will be used to manage the players current location and update the field based on where they navigate to. 

    Once a player either falls into a hole or finds their hat the game will reset.
